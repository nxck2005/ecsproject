Crowd Density Estimator (Idea)

1. Problem Statement:

    Estimate the density of people in a particular area using ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.

    Objectives:

        Detect the number of people in a defined space.
        Process the data to estimate crowd density.
        Display or alert when a threshold is exceeded.

2. Responsibilities

    CS Students:
        Data Processing and Algorithms for checking crowd density.
        Machine Learning (if applicable and feasible, e.g., image recognition).
        Integration with cloud services (if time permits).
    ECE Students:
        Sensor Integration and Data Collection.
        Microcontroller (ESP32) and Raspberry Pi interfacing.
        Power management and hardware design.

3. Research and Selection of Components

    Sensors:
        Camera Modules: For image-based density estimation using Computer Vision.
        Infrared Sensors: For proximity detection (less accurate but cost-effective).
        Ultrasonic Sensors: For measuring distance and counting objects (people).
        WiFi/Bluetooth Beacons: To detect the number of smartphones in the area (as a proxy for people count).
    Microcontroller:
        ESP32: Use for collecting data from sensors.
    Processing Unit:
        Raspberry Pi: For data processing and running algorithms.

4. System Design

    Sensor Data Collection:
        The ESP32 will gather raw data from connected sensors (e.g., cameras, ultrasonic sensors).
        The data will be sent to the Raspberry Pi for processing.
    Data Processing:
        Implement algorithms to estimate crowd density. For image data, you might consider Computer Vision techniques (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite).
        For non-image data, apply statistical or rule-based models to estimate density.
    Communication:
        Use MQTT, HTTP, or WebSocket protocols for communication between ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.
    User Interface:
        Create a web-based or local interface on the Raspberry Pi to display the crowd density in real-time.
    Alerts/Notifications:
        Set up thresholds to trigger alerts if the density exceeds a certain limit.

5. Development and Implementation

    Prototyping:
        Prototyping with a single sensor (e.g., camera module connected to Raspberry Pi) to ensure the basic system works.
    Integration:
        Integrate additional sensors as needed and fine-tune the data processing algorithms.
    Testing:
        Test the system in a controlled environment to adjust the sensitivity and accuracy of the estimations.
        Conduct field tests in different environments to ensure reliability.
    Optimization:
        Optimize the code and algorithms to ensure real-time performance.
        Consider power management strategies for the ESP32 if th8. Collaboration and Communication

    Regular Meetings: Hold regular team meetings to ensure progress is on track and integrate different components.
    Version Control: Use Git or another version control system for code management and collaboration.
    Documentation: Keep detailed documentation for each part of the project, making it easier for team members to collaborate and for future reference.e system needs to run on batteries.

6. Final Deployment

    Installation:
        Set up the hardware in the target location(s).
    Monitoring:
        Monitor the system for accuracy and make adjustments as needed.
    Documentation:
        Document the hardware setup, software code, and any calibration procedures.
    Presentation:
        Prepare a presentation and demo for your project showcasing the system's capabilities, design process, and results.

7. Advanced Considerations (Optional)

    Machine Learning: Consideration for training a machine learning model to estimate density based on image data.
    Cloud Integration: Sending data to a cloud platform for remote monitoring or larger-scale data analysis.
    Scalability: Thinking about how the system could be scaled to monitor larger areas or multiple locations.
