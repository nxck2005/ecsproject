1. Define the Problem and Objectives

    Problem Statement: Accessibility of campus events is limited by physical presence; existing solutions like YouTube do not offer sufficient privacy, integration, or customization for a university setting.
    Objectives:
        Enhance the accessibility of campus events through a dedicated streaming service.
        Ensure privacy and data protection for all streamed content.
        Integrate with campus systems for a seamless user experience.
        Customize the service to align with university branding and specific needs.

2. Project Scope

    Inclusion Criteria:
        Live streaming and archiving of university events such as lectures, sports, and ceremonies.
        Customizable features tailored to the campus community’s needs.
    Exclusion Criteria:
        Events without required permissions and rights for broadcasting.
        Use of third-party platforms that do not comply with university data governance policies.

3. Hardware and Software Requirements

    Hardware:
        Raspberry Pi units with camera modules for video capture.
        Microphones and possibly additional audio equipment for quality sound capture.
    Software:
        Custom streaming server software.
        Web-based interface for viewing and managing streams.
        Database system for managing user credentials and permissions.

4. System Design

    Video Capture and Streaming:
        Deploy Raspberry Pi cameras at designated event locations.
        Use secure streaming protocols to transmit live video to the server.
    User Interface:
        Develop a web interface that reflects university branding and is accessible from both desktop and mobile devices.
        Include features such as live chat, event schedules, and interactive polls.
    Authentication and Security:
        Implement OAuth for secure and flexible user authentication, integrating with existing university credentials.
        Use HTTPS for secure transmission of content and user data.
        Employ role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different types of users (students, faculty, staff, alumni).

5. Customization and Integration

    Integration with Campus Systems:
        Sync with the university calendar for automatic scheduling and notifications of upcoming events.
        Integrate with the university’s Learning Management System (LMS) for educational content.
    Custom Features:
        Develop accessibility features such as closed captions and sign language translation overlays.

6. Development Plan

    Phase 1: Prototype Development
        Set up a single Raspberry Pi to capture and stream a small event.
        Test integration with the university authentication system.
    Phase 2: System Integration and Scaling
        Expand the number of streaming locations.
        Enhance the web interface with additional interactive features and mobile responsiveness.
    Phase 3: Security and Compliance Testing
        Implement comprehensive security measures.
        Ensure compliance with legal and university policies.
    Phase 4: Launch and Iterative Improvement
        Roll out the system for widespread use across campus.
        Gather feedback and continuously improve the system based on user input.

7. Maintenance and Evaluation

    Routine Maintenance:
        Regularly update software components.
        Monitor system performance and security.
    Evaluation and Reporting:
        Analyze usage statistics and user feedback.
        Prepare reports on system impact and areas for improvement.

8. Budget and Resource Allocation

    Estimate Costs:
        Initial hardware and software development.
        Ongoing maintenance and possible feature expansions.
    Resource Allocation:
        Assign project roles among IT staff, student developers, and external consultants if needed.

9. Risk Management

    Technical Risks:
        Address potential issues such as system downtime or performance bottlenecks.
    Operational Risks:
        Plan for operational contingencies such as data breaches or unauthorized access.
    Compliance Risks:
        Ensure all content and processes comply with privacy laws and university regulations.
