1. Define the Problem and Objectives

    Problem Statement: Difficulty in finding spots with optimal Wi-Fi connectivity on campus.
    Objectives:
        Collect real-time data on Wi-Fi signal strength and speed across various campus locations.
        Display this data on a live, interactive map accessible by students and staff.

2. Team Roles and Responsibilities

    CS Students:
        Develop the backend and frontend software for data collection and map visualization.
        Handle network security and data privacy concerns.
    ECE Students:
        Design and deploy the ESP32-based sensor network.
        Manage power supply and data transmission issues.

3. Hardware and Software Requirements

    Hardware:
        ESP32 modules to serve as nodes for collecting Wi-Fi data.
        Raspberry Pi to act as the server for hosting the live map.
        Optional: Battery packs or power solutions for ESP32 modules.
    Software:
        Wi-Fi analysis software to run on ESP32 for measuring signal strength and speed.
        Web server and database software on Raspberry Pi (e.g., Apache, MySQL).
        Web development tools for creating the interactive map (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, possibly Google Maps API or Leaflet for mapping).

4. System Design and Architecture

    Data Collection:
        ESP32 nodes scan for Wi-Fi networks at their locations and measure signal strength and speed.
        Data collected includes Wi-Fi network SSID, signal strength, speed, and timestamp.
    Data Transmission:
        ESP32 nodes send data to the Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi or another suitable wireless communication protocol.
    Data Processing and Storage:
        Raspberry Pi processes incoming data and stores it in a database.
    User Interface:
        Develop a web interface that fetches data from the Raspberry Pi and displays it on a live map, allowing users to view Wi-Fi quality across campus.

5. Development Process

    Prototyping:
        Start by setting up a single ESP32 module to collect and transmit Wi-Fi data to the Raspberry Pi.
        Develop a basic version of the web interface to display this data.
    Scaling Up:
        Incrementally add more ESP32 nodes across different campus locations.
        Enhance the web interface to handle increased data volume and provide better user interaction.
    Testing:
        Test the system in a limited area to troubleshoot and optimize
